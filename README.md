# Basic OpenCV implementation on images using android app

- Start using OpenCV to develop android applications

- Implementation of interesting algorithms to enhance an image

- Enhancing image can be done by reducing noise - By Gaussian blur, Median blur, Average blur

- Conversion of image to gray scale

- Flipping of image

- Process of detecting edges (Object boundaries) - By Canny edge detector, Sobel edge detector
