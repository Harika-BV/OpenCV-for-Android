**Basic OpenCV implementation on images using android app**

> Start using OpenCV to develop android applications

> Implementation of interesting algorithms to enhance an image

> Enhancing image can be done by reducing noise - By Gaussian blur, Median blur, Average blur

> Conversion of image to gray scale

> Flipping of image

> Process of detecting edges (Object boundaries) - By Canny edge detector, Sobel edge detector
